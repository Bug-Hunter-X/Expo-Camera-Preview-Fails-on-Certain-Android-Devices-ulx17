# Expo Camera Preview Issue on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on specific Android devices. The camera preview may fail to render correctly, resulting in a black screen or a distorted image. This is an intermittent problem, meaning it does not always occur.

## Bug Description
The `Camera` component from Expo's `expo-camera` package sometimes fails to display the camera preview properly. The issue is device-specific and does not manifest consistently across all Android devices.  This makes debugging challenging.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an affected Android device (testing across multiple devices is recommended).
3. Observe the camera preview. You may see a black screen or a distorted image, sometimes after several attempts.

## Potential Causes

* **Device-specific hardware or software incompatibilities:**  The problem might stem from differences in Android versions, camera drivers, or other device-specific factors. 
* **Asynchronous operations:**  A potential race condition within the Expo Camera implementation could be leading to the preview rendering issue. 
* **Permissions issues (less likely):** While less probable, ensure the app has the necessary camera permissions.

## Solution (bugSolution.js)
While a definitive fix requires a deeper investigation into the Expo SDK, workarounds like implementing camera preview re-initialization or utilizing alternative camera libraries might improve stability in some cases.  This might not be an ideal solution, however.
